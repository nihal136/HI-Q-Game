Algorithm pegSolataire{
if there is only n=1 peg left,
  if it is in center, return indicating we found a solution,
  otherwise, we did not;
if this board is flagged as congruent to one that has been determined to not lead a solution, return indicating we
did not find one,
otherwise, for each possible jump,
  modify the board to account for the jump, and call the backtracking algorithm recursively using memotization techinique, where
    if the algorithm indicates success, record the jump and return indicating we found a solution,
    otherwise, reset the board to the state it was in prior to making a jump; and

the loop will only finish if none of the possible jumps led to a solution, so flag that this board has been found not to 
find a solution and return indicating we did not find one.
